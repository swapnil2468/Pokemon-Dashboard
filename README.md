About the Project 📊
Pokémon has been a beloved series for fans of all ages, with its diverse characters, thrilling battles, and exciting adventures. This Pokémon Dashboard project was built out of curiosity and a love for the franchise, aiming to present something truly unique in data analytics. As a dedicated Pokémon fan, working on this project was an enjoyable and rewarding experience!

What Makes This Project Stand Out? 🔥
👉 While several Pokémon dashboards exist online, this one is one-of-a-kind, designed from scratch with a fresh perspective.

👉 The evolution page is designed differently, offering a new way to explore Pokémon transformations.

👉 The dataset used in this project is not available anywhere online—it was created from scratch by web scraping multiple sources.

👉 Just like in the anime where trainers carry a Pokédex, this project brings a virtual Pokédex experience to life! 😂😂
