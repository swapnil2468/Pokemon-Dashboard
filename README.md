# About the Project 📊
Pokemon is one of the famous cartoon series which is been loved by all age group people. Different types of Pokemons and their powers along with journey with their trainers is quite interesting and amazing. The Pokemon Dashboard project is fun data analytics project which is made with curosity to make something different. As I am a Pokemon fan developing this project was a fun task for me.

# Key features about the project 🔥

👉 There are some pokemon dashboard projects availabe on internet but the project developed here will not be found anywhere it is a unique one.

👉 The evolution page of the project is bit different.

👉 The dataset which is been used in the project is not availabe anywhere on internet. The dataset and images of the dataset are made by web scrapping through various websites.

👉 If you have seen the Pokemon cartoon each trainer has a Pokedex with them, here we have tried to make a similar kind of Pokedex but its a virtual one. 😂😂
