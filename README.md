# About the Project 📊
Pokemon is one of the famous cartoon series which is been loved by all age group people. Different types of Pokemons and their powers along with journey with their trainers is quite interesting and amazing. The Pokemon Dashboard project is a fun data analytics project which is made with curiosity to make something different. As I am a Pokemon fan, developing this project was a fun task for me.

# Key Features of the Project 🔥

👉 There are some Pokemon dashboard projects available on the internet, but the project developed here is unique and cannot be found anywhere else.

👉 The evolution page of the project is a bit different from other dashboards.

👉 The dataset used in the project is not available anywhere on the internet. The dataset and images were created by web scraping various websites.

👉 If you have seen the Pokemon cartoon, each trainer has a Pokedex with them. Here, we have tried to make a similar kind of Pokedex, but it is a virtual one. 😂😂
